Specifically, saturated fatty acids induce hepcidin expression by activating the nucleo-cytosolic shuttling of Human Antigen R (HuR), which stabilizes hepcidin mRNA through direct interaction with the AU-rich element in its 3’UTR. In addition, I have discovered that ceramide, a lipid intermediate, activates inflammatory signaling pathway, JAK/STAT3, and STAT3 directly interacts with its response element in the hepcidin promoter, therefore activates transcription.",
