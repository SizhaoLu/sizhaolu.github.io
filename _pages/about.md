As a molecular biologist, I specialize in cardiovascular and metabolic disease research. My expertise spans from developing preclinical models of cardiovascular diseases to investigating molecular signaling pathways. I have extensive experience in bioinformatics analysis of omics data and its applications in research. I am particularly passionate about uncovering the genetic foundations of diseases and advancing personalized treatment approaches.
