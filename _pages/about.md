# About Me

### PhD Research

I received my PhD from the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, where I investigated the critical intersection of lipid and iron metabolism. My dissertation research revealed novel mechanisms by which lipids influence hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis. By characterizing how fatty acids and ceramides upregulate hepcidin expression, I contributed fundamental insights to the field, published in the *Journal of Biological Chemistry* and *PLOS ONE*.

### Postdoctoral Research

As a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Mary Weiser-Evans' laboratory, I focused on smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and vascular resident progenitor cells in vascular pathology. Key achievements include:

- Establishing a novel lineage tracing system for SMC-derived vascular progenitor (AdvSca1-SM) cells, demonstrating their essential role in vascular injury and remodeling
- Expanding our understanding of these progenitors in atherosclerosis and cardiac fibrosis
- Leading collaborative investigations into their role in the tumor microenvironment

My work was recognized through an American Heart Association fellowship and several awards, including the prestigious ATVB Young Investigator Award.

### Current Position & Future Goals

Currently, I serve as an Assistant Professor in the Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. With 28 publications (9 as first author) and numerous presentations at international conferences, I have established expertise in cardiovascular research.

My research vision focuses on:
- Decoding complex signaling networks in cardiovascular and other diseases
- Developing precision therapeutic approaches guided by genomic insights
- Building an independent research program that integrates Cardiovascular Biology, Genomics, and Bioinformatics
